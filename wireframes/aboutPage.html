            <h2>I'm an aspiring software engineer with a penchant for UI/UX.</h2>
            <p>I adore challenges. I delight in enigmas. So, I guess you could say that I relish challenging puzzles. It's for this reason that I love programming.</p>
            <p>Before, I used to study actuarial science and finance. I even graduated with a degree joint-majoring in both of those! I leverage that to work on the backend, and I use my creative side to work on the frontend. HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and I are good friends, and Ruby and I know each otherâ€™s names.</p>
            <p>If I'm not working, you can find me playing video games (I'm pretty good at FPSs), watching or reading Sci-Fi (bring back Stargate!), or enjoying a nice can of LaCroix.</p>
